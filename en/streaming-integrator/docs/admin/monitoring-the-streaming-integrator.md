# Monitoring the Streaming Integrator

The Status Dashboard allows you to monitor the metrics of a stand-alone Streaming Integrator instance or a Streaming Integrator cluster. This involves
monitoring whether all processes of the Streaming Integrator setup are working in a healthy manner, monitoring the current status of a Streaming Integrator node, and viewing
metrics relating to the history of a node or the cluster. Both JVM level metrics or Siddhi application level metrics can be viewed from the Status Dashboard.

The following sections cover how to configure the Status Dashboard and analyze statistics relating to your Streaming Integrator deployment in it.

## System requirements

This use case involves running both the Streaming Integrator and the Analytics Dashboard at the same time. The system requirements are as follows:

For the Streaming Integrator:

<table>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<th>Memory</th>
<td><p><ul><li>~ 2 GB per streaming integrator node (and therefore, 4 GB for the recommended Minimum HA cluster<li>2 CPU cores minimum. It is recommended to allocate 4 cores.</li></li><li>~ 2 GB is the initial heap (-Xms)  required for the server startup. The maximum heap size is 4 GB (-Xmx)</li></ul></p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<th>Disk</th>
<td><p><li>~ 480 MB, excluding space allocated for log files and databases.</li></p></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

For the Analytics Dashboard:

<table>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<th>Memory</th>
<td><p><ul><li>~ 2 GB minimum, 4 GB Maximum<li>2 CPU cores minimum. It is recommended to allocate 4 cores.</li></li><li>~ 512 MB heap size. This is generally sufficient to process typical SOAP messages but the requirements vary with larger message sizes and  the number of messages processed concurrently.</li></ul></p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<th>Disk</th>
<td><p><li>~ 480 MB, excluding space allocated for log files and databases.</li></p></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

## Configuring the Status Dashboard

The following sections cover the configurations that need to be done in
order to view statistics relating to the performance of your Streaming Integrator
deployment in the Status Dashboard.

!!! tip "Before you begin""
    - Download the Analytics Dashboard from the [WSO2 Analytics Dashboard Github Repository](https://github.com/wso2/analytics-dashboard/releases).
    - Once you extract the zip file, the extracted location is referred to as the `<DASHBOARD_HOME>` in the rest of this section.
    

### Assigning unique carbon IDs to nodes

Carbon metrics uses the carbon ID as the source ID for metrics. Therefore, all the worker nodes are required to have a **unique carbon ID** defined in the
`wso2.carbon:` section of the `<SI_HOME>/conf/server/deployment.yaml` file as shown in the extract below.

!!! info
    You need to ensure that the carbon ID of each node is unique because it is required for the Status dashboard to identify the worker nodes and display their statistics accordingly.


``` xml
    wso2.carbon:
        # value to uniquely identify a server
      id: wso2-si-1
        # server name
      name: WSO2 Streaming Integrator
        # server type
      type: wso2-si
        # ports used by this server
      ports:
          # port offset
        offset: 0
```



### Setting up the database

To monitor statistics in the Status Dashboard, you need a shared metrics database that stores the metrics of all the nodes.

Set up a database of the required type by following the steps below. In this section, a MySQL database is created as an example.

!!! info
    The Status Dashboard is only supported with H2, MySQL, MSSQL and Oracle database types. It is configured with the H2 database type by default. If you want to continue to use H2, skip this step.


1. Download and install the required database type. For this example, let's download and install [MySQL Server](http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/).

2. Download the required database driver. For this example, download the [MySQL JDBC driver](http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/connector/j/).

3. Unzip the database driver you downloaded, copy its JAR file (`mysql-connector-java-x.x.xx-bin.jar` in this example), and place it in the `<DASHBOARD_HOME>/lib` directory.

4. Enter the following command in a terminal/command window, where `username` is the username you want to use to access the databases.

    `mysql -u username -p`

5. When prompted, specify the password you are using to access the databases with the username you specified.

6. Create two databases named `WSO2_METRICS_DB` (to store metrics data) and `WSO2_STATUS_DASHBOARD_DB` (to store statistics) with tables. To create MySQL databases and tables for this example, run the following commands.

    ``` java
        mysql> create database WSO2_METRICS_DB;
        mysql> use WSO2_METRICS_DB;
        mysql> source <DASHBOARD_HOME>/wso2/monitor/dbscripts/metrics/mysql.sql;
        mysql> grant all privileges on WSO2_METRICS_DB.* TO 'username'@'localhost';
    ```

    ``` java
            mysql> create database WSO2_STATUS_DASHBOARD_DB;
            mysql> use WSO2_STATUS_DASHBOARD_DB;
            mysql> source <DASHBOARD_HOME>/wso2/monitor/dbscripts/metrics/mysql.sql;
            mysql> grant all privileges on WSO2_STATUS_DASHBOARD_DB.* TO 'username'@'localhost';
    ```
    !!! tip
        - The syntax of the MySQL commands depend on the MySQL version. The given systax is for MySQL 8x versions. Check the syntax for the version you are using when performing this step. 
        - Replace <DASHBOARD_HOME> with the path to your <DASHBOARD_HOME>.
        - Replace `'username'@'localhost'` with your username and host name (e.g., `'root'@'localhost'`)

7. Create two datasources named `WSO2_METRICS_DB` and `WSO2_STATUS_DASHBOARD_DB` by adding the following datasource configurations under the `wso2.datasources:` section of the `<DASHBOARD_HOME>/conf/monitor/deployment.yaml` file.

    !!! info
        The names of the data sources must be the same as the names of the database tables you created for metrics and statistics. You need to change the values for the `username` and `password` parameters to the username and password that you are using to access the MySQL database.

        For detailed information about datasources, see [carbon-datasources](https://github.com/wso2/carbon-datasources/).

### Configuring metrics

This section explains how to configure metrics for your status dashboard.

**Configuring worker metrics**

To enable metrics and to configure metric-related properties, do the
following configurations in the `<SI_HOME>/conf/server/deployment.yaml` file for the
required SI nodes.

1. To enable Carbon metrics, set the `enabled` property to `true` under `wso2.metrics` as shown below.

    ``` xml
            wso2.metrics:
              enabled: true
    ```

2. To enable JDBC reporting, set the `Enable JDBC parameter` to `true` in the `wso2.metrics.jdbc:` -> `reporting:` subsection as shown below. If JDBC reporting
 is not enabled, only real-time metrics are displayed in the first page of the Status dashboard, and information relating to metrics history is not displayed in
  the other pages of the dashboard. To render the first entry of the graph, you need to wait for the time duration specified as the `pollingPeriod`.

    ``` xml
            # Enable JDBC Reporter
             name: JDBC
             enabled: true
             pollingPeriod: 60
    ```

3. Under `wso2.metrics.jdbc` , configure the following properties to clean up the database entries.

    ``` xml
            wso2.metrics.jdbc:
              # Data Source Configurations for JDBC Reporters
              dataSource:
                # Default Data Source Configuration
                - &JDBC01

4. JVM metrics of which the log level is set to `OFF` are not measured by default. If you need to monitor one or more of them, add the relevant metric name(s)
under the `wso2.metrics:` -> `levels` subsection as shown in the extract below. As shown below, you also need to mention log4j mode in which the metrics need to be monitored (i.e., `           OFF          ` ,
`INFO`, `DEBUG`, `TRACE`, or `ALL`).

**Configuring Siddhi application metrics**

To enable Siddhi application level metrics for a Siddhi application, you need to add the `@app:statistics` annotation below the Siddhi application name in the
Siddhi file as shown in the example below.

``` sql
    @App:name('TestMetrics')
    @app:statistics(reporter = 'jdbc')
    define stream TestStream (message string);
```

The following are the metrics measured for a Siddhi application.

!!! info
    The default level after enabling metrics is `INFO` for all the metrics listed in the following table.

    <table>
    <thead>
    <tr class="header">
    <th>Metric</th>
    <th>Components to which the metric is applied</th>

### Configuring cluster credentials

In order to access the nodes in a cluster and derive statistics, you need to maintain and share a user name and a password for each node in a SI cluster. This
user name and password must be specified in the `<DASHBOARD_HOME>/conf/monitor/deployment.yaml` file. If you want to secure sensitive information such as the
user name and the password, you can encrypt them via WSO2 Secure Vault.

1. To specify the user name and the password to access a node, define them under the `wso2.status.dashboard` section as shown in the following example.

    ``` xml
        wso2.status.dashboard:
          pollingInterval: 5
          metricsDatasourceName: 'WSO2_METRICS_DB'
          dashboardDatasourceName: 'WSO2_STATUS_DASHBOARD_DB'
          workerAccessCredentials:
            username: 'admin'
            password: 'admin'
    ```

2. To encrypt the user name and the password you defined, define aliases for them as described in [Protecting Sensitive Data via the Secure Vault](protecting-sensitive-data-via-the-secure-vault.md).

    !!! info
        This functionality is currently supported only for single tenant environments.


### Configuring permissions

The following are the three levels of permissions that can be granted for the users of the Status Dashboard.

<table>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th>Permission Level</th>
<th>Granted permissions</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><code>             SysAdmin            </code></td>
<td><ul>
<li>Enabling/disabling metrics</li>
<li>Adding workers</li>
<li>Deleting workers</li>
<li>Viewing workers</li>
</ul></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><code>             Developers            </code></td>
<td><ul>
<li>Adding workers</li>
<li>Deleting workers</li>
<li>Viewing workers</li>
</ul></td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td><code>             Viewers            </code></td>
<td>Viewing workers</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

The `admin user` in the user store is assigned the `SysAdmin` permission level by default.

To assign different permission levels to different roles, you can list the required roles under the relevant permission level in the `wso2.status.dashboard`
section of the
`<DASHBOARD_HOME>/conf/monitor/deployment.yaml` file as shown in the extract below.

``` xml
    wso2.status.dashboard:
      sysAdminRoles:
        - role_1
      developerRoles:
        - role_2
      viewerRoles:
        - role_3
```

!!! info
    The display name of the roles given in the configuration must be present in the user store. To configure user store check, [User Management](../admin/user-management.md).

## Accessing the Status Dashboard

To access the Status Dashboard, follow the procedure below:

1. In the terminal, navigate to the `<DASHBOARD_HOME>/bin` directory and issue the relevant command to start the dashboard profile based on your operating system.

    - For Windows: `monitor.bat`
    - For Linux : `./monitor.sh`

2. Access the Status Dashboard via the following URL format.

    `https://localhost:<DASHBOARD_PORT>/monitoring

    e.g., https://0.0.0.0:9648/monitoring
    
3. Sign in by entering `admin` as both the user name and the password.

After signing in, this opens  the Status Dashboard with the nodes that you have already added as shown in the example below.

![Status Dashboard Overview](../images/monitoring-the-streaming-integrator/status_dashboard_overview.png)

If no nodes are displayed, add the nodes for which you wnt to view statistics by following the steps in [Adding a node to the dashboard](#adding-a-node-to-the-dashboard).

## Node overview

Once you login to the status dashboard, the nodes that are already added
to the Status Dashboard are displayed as shown in the following example:

### Adding a node to the dashboard

If no nodes are displayed, you can add the nodes for which you want to
view the status by following the procedure below:

1. Click **ADD NEW NODE**.

    ![Add New Node](../images/monitoring-the-streaming-integrator/add-new-node-button.png)

    This opens the following dialog box.

    ![Add New Node dialog box](../images/monitoring-the-streaming-integrator/add-new-node.png)

2. Enter the following information in the dialog box and click **ADD  NODE** to add a gadget for the required node in the **Node Overview** page.

    1. In the **Host** parameter, enter the host ID of the node you want to add.

    2. In the **Port** parameter, enter the port number of the node you want to add.

3. If the node you added is currently unreachable, the following dialog box is displayed.

    ![Unreachable Node](../images/monitoring-the-streaming-integrator/unreachable-node.png)

    Click either **WORKER** or **MANAGER.** If you click **WORKER**, the node is displayed under **Never Reached**. If you click **Manager** , the node is displayed under **Distributed Deployments** as shown below.

    ![Unreachable nodes](../images/monitoring-the-streaming-integrator/distributed-deployment-with-unreachable-manager.png)

!!! info
    The following basic details are displayed for each node.

    -   **CPU Usage** : The CPU resources consumed by the Streaming Integrator node out of the
        available CPU resources in the machine in which it is deployed is
        expressed as a percentage.
    -   **Memory Usage** : The memory consumed by the node as a percentage
        of the total memory available in the system.
    -   **Load Average** :
    -   **Siddhi Apps** : The total number of Siddhi applications deployed
        in the node.
